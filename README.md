# 2D Top-Down RPG Studies

## Overview
This project is a prototype for a 2D top-down RPG developed in Game Maker. The goal is to study and implement common mechanics found in top-down RPGs, such as character animations, multi-directional movement, and environmental interaction. This project serves as a foundation for the development of future games in the genre.
